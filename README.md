Now you can have ALL the mems
This script will allow you to take all the resources(pics, swfs, pdfs etc.) that are on boards specified in relevants.
for some weird reason the resources are not placed in their respective directories, i'm figuring it out, also relevant board list length must be even since threads stall if you launch too many at the time
